=Funf Data Processing=

This project contains convenience scripts for processing Funf data files.  
These files are designed to be used as standalone scripts, and not as a library to be imported.
Make sure to download and install the dependencies before running the scripts.


==Data Processing==
Scripts for processing data once it has been retrieved from devices.

Dependencies:
	* PyCrypto ( https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/ )


===decrypt.py===
Decrypts files using the DES key specified, or the one included in this script.  Keeps a backup copy of the original file.  
*WARNING:* This script does not detect if a file has already been decrypted. Decrypting a file that is not encrypted will scramble the file.

===dbdecrypt.py===
Safe script for decrypting sqlite3 db files.  Checks to see if the file can be opened by Sqlite.  Only if it cannot open the file, it decrypts it.

===dbmerge.py===
Merge many database files into one file.



==Simple Server==
A basic reference HTTP server for communicating with Funf applications.  
The server hosts one configuration file (/config), and accepts multipart form uploads of files (/data).

This is meant to be a reference implementation for prototyping, and not meant to be a stable long running implementation.
